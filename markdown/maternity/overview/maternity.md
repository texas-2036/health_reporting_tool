Appropriate maternal health care, such as early prenatal care, and undertaking activities to reduce risk factors, such as smoking cessation, are critical to better birth outcomes. A healthy start for infants can enhance life, educational, and work outcomes. Access to family planning also can prevent unintended pregnancies and allow families to determine birth spacing.

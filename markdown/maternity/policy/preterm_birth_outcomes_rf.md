In 2018 in Texas, 66% of infant deaths were among babies born preterm. In addition to having a higher risk of infant mortality, babies born preterm have higher risk of:

* low birth weight;
* health problems, such as developing infections and breathing problems;
* conditions that affect the brain, heart, liver, eyes, lungs, intestines, and other organs;
* having intellectual and developmental disabilities;
* having mental health and behavior issues; and
* having worse school outcomes.

Risk factors for preterm birth include:

* Tobacco use and substance abuse;
* Maternal physical health concerns, including obesity, diabetes, and high blood pressure;
* Maternal mental health concerns, including depression and psychological or social stress;
* Having  multiple births, such as twins or triplets; 
Birth spacing of less than 18 months between births;
* Maternal age, which is a higher risk factor among very young and older mothers; and
* Lacking adequate preconception, prenatal, and interconception care.

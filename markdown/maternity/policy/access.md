In Texas in 2017, there were 150 counties with no physician practicing obstetrics and gynecology.

In 2017, 37.3 percent of Texas obstetricians/gynecologists (OB/GYNs) were within ten years of retirement age (older than 55 years of age), while the proportion of OB/GYNs 40 years old or younger was 21.7 percent. OB/GYN age is among the factors included in a Department of State Health Services Analysis^[1] of the projected OB/GYN shortage in 2030. The OB/GYN shortage rate in 2030 is expected to range from 12.8% in Public Health Region 6/5S, which is the Gulf Coast, to 39.9% in Public Health Region 11, which is the Rio Grande Valley.

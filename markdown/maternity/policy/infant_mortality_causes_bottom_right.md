**The rate of infant mortality for Black infants was nearly double the rate for other race/ethnicities in 2017 at 10.9 deaths per 1,000 live births.  This compares to 5.5 for Hispanic infants, 4.8 for White infants, and 4.1 for infants classified as “Other” race/ethnicity.**

For Black infants, the leading cause of death was preterm birth and low birth weight as opposed to birth defects.

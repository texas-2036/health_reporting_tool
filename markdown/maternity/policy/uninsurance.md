Women with health insurance prior to pregnancy are more likely to get regular preventive care and identify and address health concerns that could impact their pregnancy. Women with health insurance during pregnancy are more likely to get routine prenatal care. In 2018, 9.0% of Texas women who paid for their own delivery received no prenatal care, compared with 1.4% among women whose delivery was covered by private insurance and 3.4% of women whose delivery was covered by Medicaid.^[1]

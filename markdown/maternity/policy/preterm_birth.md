The preterm birth rate is defined as a birth that occurs at less than 37 weeks of pregnancy. Preterm births were trending down in both the U.S. and Texas until 2015 but began to rise again in 2016. In 2018, the preterm birth rate in Texas was 10.8% versus 10.0% in the U.S. This figure ranks Texas 38th in the nation for the preterm rate.

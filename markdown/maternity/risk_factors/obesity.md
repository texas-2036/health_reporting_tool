Obesity rates among women of child-bearing age (18-44 years) have been rising. Obesity is defined as having a Body Mass Index (BMI) of 30.0 or greater.  Obesity is a major contributor to reproductive health.

Women who are obese may have a harder time getting pregnant. If they are taking contraception, their contraception may be less effective.
When pregnant, women with obesity also are more likely to:

* have or develop pregnancy-related diabetes or high blood pressure;
* have a miscarriage or stillbirth;
* deliver prematurely;
* have a C-section and delivery-related issues such as postpartum hemorrhage; and
* have a baby with a birth defect or other long term health consequences.

To combat these issues, women should eat healthy foods and be physically active. As for all women, women with obesity should engage in prenatal care, during which they can be monitored for changes to their blood sugar and blood pressure.

**Among women of child-bearing age, the obesity rate in Texas is 32.1% versus 28.7% nationally. This ranks Texas 35th in the nation and 11th among Texasâ€™ 12 peer states.**

Smoking can be extremely harmful to pregnant moms and babies. It is best for women to quit smoking and other tobacco use before deciding to become pregnant. Women can try to quit on their own or Texas Medicaid and most Texas health insurers cover tobacco cessation services for pregnant women.

Babies of mothers who smoke during pregnancy are at higher risk for the following:

* Premature birth
* Birth defects
* Low birthweight
* Miscarriage or stillbirth
* Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS)

Secondhand smoke can also lead to higher risk of low birthweight or birth defects in babies when women are exposed during pregnancy. Infants exposed to secondhand smoke also are at higher risk for conditions like asthma, bronchitis, ear infections, and pneumonia.

The use of other tobacco products, including e-cigarettes, during pregnancy is also harmful.

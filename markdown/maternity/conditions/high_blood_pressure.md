Women who have high blood pressure, or hypertension, before pregnancy or who develop high blood pressure for the first time during pregnancy (gestational hypertension) are at higher risk for adverse pregnancy outcomes. They are also at risk of experiencing preeclampsia, which is high blood pressure and signs of damage to another organ system.

Women with any type of high blood pressure during pregnancy have a higher risk of:

* serious health conditions like heart attack, stroke, gestational diabetes, pulmonary edema (fluid in the lungs), and kidney failure;
*preterm delivery;
* requiring a C-section delivery;
* having a baby with fetal growth restriction from not getting enough oxygen and nutrients;
* having a low birthweight baby; and
* having a baby who dies in the womb or during the first 28 days of life.

High blood pressure during pregnancy can be managed through appropriate prenatal care, eating healthy, exercising regularly, and home blood pressure monitoring, and taking medications, if recommended by a doctor.

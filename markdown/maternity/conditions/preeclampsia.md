Preeclampsia is high blood pressure during pregnancy that is accompanied by signs of damage to another organ system, most often the kidneys and liver. Preeclampsia occurs in some women after the 20th week of pregnancy. Signs and symptoms of preeclampsia (some of which are also symptoms in healthy pregnancies), include:

* Changes in vision, like blurriness, flashing lights, seeing spots or being sensitive to light
* Headache that doesnâ€™t go away
* Nausea, vomiting or dizziness
* Pain in the upper right belly area or in the shoulder
* Sudden weight gain (2 to 5 pounds in a week)
* Swelling in the legs, hands or face
* Trouble breathing

Women experiencing preeclampsia should have additional checkups and monitoring during their pregnancy. Depending on the severity of the preeclampsia, women may be hospitalized so that their pregnancy can be more closely monitored. The doctor also may recommend delivering early for both the health of the mother and the baby.

Women coping with depression during pregnancy should strive to reduce stress, get adequate rest, exercise regularly, stay connected with social supports, and eat healthy foods.  In addition to these activities, a woman may work with her prenatal care provider, primary care provider, and a mental health provider in deciding the right treatment for depression during pregnancy. Treatment options include:

Therapy. The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force specifically recommends cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) or interpersonal therapy (IPT).

Support Groups. This includes online support groups. Seek people with shared experiences.

Medicine. Medicine should be prescribed by a medical professional and safe for use during and after pregnancy.

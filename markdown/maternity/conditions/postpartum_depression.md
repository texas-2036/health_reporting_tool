Postpartum depression is a form of depression that occurs in some women during the time following pregnancy and delivery. It is one of the most common medical complications during the postpartum period (i.e. six months following childbirth) and is associated with adverse outcomes for both mother and child.
In 2015, more than 1 in 7 new Texas mothers (14.7%) reported frequent postpartum depressive symptoms, including feeling sad, hopeless, withdrawn, and disconnected from their baby. This was higher than the national rate of 12.8%, and was an increase from 13.5% in 2014.

Women experiencing postpartum depression may have challenges caring for themselves and their baby, such as:^[1

* skipping postpartum checkups;
* skipping babyâ€™s well-child visits;
* following recommended safe behaviors such as placing baby in safe sleeping positions or properly in the car seat; and
* trouble bonding with baby and continuing planned breastfeeding.

Treatment for postpartum depression may be similar to treatment for depression during pregnancy. Providers will have to take into account if a woman is breastfeeding when determining what, if any, medications are recommended. Unfortunately, women are significantly less likely to be insured during the postpartum period in Texas than during pregnancy, so care may be more challenging to access.

Primary care access can become even more critical among older adults, because they often require coordination of care for multiple chronic conditions.

In 2018, 91.2% of Texans age 65 and older reported havng a personal doctor or health care provider.   This ranks Texas 42nd in the nation for this measure. The national average is 93.7%. 

Having a regular health care provider is associated with a number of benefits, including:

* Lower health care costs and better overall health status.
* Improvements in preventive care.
* Improvements in chronic care management for conditions such as hypertension and high cholesterol.
* Fewer emergency department visits for non-urgent or avoidable problems.
* A reduced risk of mortality.

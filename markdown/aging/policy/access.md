Primary care access can become even more critical among older adults, because they often require coordination of care for multiple chronic conditions.  

Among Texans ages 65 and older, 91.2% reported having a personal doctor or health care provider. This ranks Texas 42nd in the nation and last among Texas 2036 peer states. The national average is 93.7%. 

Good primary care is associated with lower health care costs and better health outcomes. Patients with a usual source of care are more likely to receive preventive care and avoid using the emergency department for nonurgent conditions.^[1]

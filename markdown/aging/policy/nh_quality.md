Texas ranks 50th in the nation in nursing home quality as measured by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services star rankings. For a three-month period spanning 2018-2019, the percentage of certified nursing home beds rated four- or five-stars in Texas was 30.1% versus 47.3% in the United States.

During the COVID-19 crisis, quality care in nursing facilities and assisted living has become even more critical due to the susceptibility of the aging population to worse outcomes from the illness. Nursing and assisted living facility residents have represented over 29% of COVID-19 deaths in Texas.

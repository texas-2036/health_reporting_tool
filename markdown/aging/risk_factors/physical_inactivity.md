Among Texas adults ages 65+ in fair or better health, the physical inactivity rate (meaning no physical activity outside a regular job) is 33.6%. This ranks Texas 39th in the nation and worst among Texas 2036 peer states. Even moderate increases in physical activity can greatly reduce risk of adverse health outcomes.

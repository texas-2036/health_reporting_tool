Social isolation can adversely impact quality of life and both physical and mental health. For example, social isolation has been associated with^[1] :

* a significantly increased risk of premature mortality from all causes; 
* an approximately 50 percent increased risk of developing dementia;
* an increased risk of poor health outcomes from chronic conditions, particularly cardiovascular conditions; and 
* increased depression, anxiety,  thoughts of suicide, and suicide attempts. 

These potential poor outcomes can be mediated by strengthening social networks. Both during the COVID-19 pandemic and in the evolving social landscape, increasing senior access to technologies and broadband is one way to increase opportunities for social engagement. Health care systems can play a role in identifying older adults at risk of social isolation and considering health practices and interventions that can reduce potential health consequences for patients, such as addressing hearing loss or mobility issues.

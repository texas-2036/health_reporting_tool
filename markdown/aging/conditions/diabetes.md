The percentage of adults with diabetes increases with age. The rate of diabetes among people 65 years and older in Texas was 29.5% in 2019 versus 23.9% for the United States. This ranked Texas 49th for the diabetes rate among seniors.  

According to the National Center for Health Statistics, diabetes was the seventh leading cause of death among seniors in 2017, contributing significantly to deaths from heart disease and stroke. Seniors, who are already at a higher risk of severe disease and mortality from COVID-19, are at even greater risk if they have type 2 diabetes. 

Seniors can help control their diabetes by:

* Eating healthy
* Exercising
* Taking medications, as required
* Routinely checking blood sugar levels
* Managing blood pressure and cholesterol
* Have yearly eye exams and kidney labs

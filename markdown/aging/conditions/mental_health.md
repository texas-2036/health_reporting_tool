In 2018, 8.7% of Texans age 65 and older reported their mental health was not good 14 or more days in the past 30 days in 2018. This ranked Texas seniors at 38th in the nation on this measure of frequent mental distress. 

Frequent mental distress is a measure based on self-reported poor mental health days. The measure aims to capture the population experiencing persistent, and likely severe, mental health issues, which may have a significant impact on health-related quality of life and overall wellness. There is a strong relationship between the 14-day period and clinically diagnosed mental disorders, such as depression and anxiety.

A healthy mental state is essential to overall positive health and wellness. Mental health issues, however, can be difficult to identify in older adults and often go undiagnosed and untreated. In extreme cases, untreated chronic or severe psychological distress can lead to suicide, for which seniors ages 85 and older, have the second highest rate in the nation at 19.07 deaths per 100,000 adults in 2018.

Frequent mental distress is associated with a number of other health conditions that pose problems for seniors including:

* Physical inactivity
* Insufficient sleep
* Obesity
* Smoking
* Alcohol consumption

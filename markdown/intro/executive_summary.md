The Health Evaluation of Life Phases (HELP) tool demonstrates some bright spots for the health of Texans but also shows many opportunities for improvement in health care access, coverage, and health behaviors. Improving the health status of our population will better position Texas among peer states by supporting strong communities and a thriving economic environment.    

In its 2019 Annual Report, America’s Health Rankings, which ranks states by a number of health outcomes and measures of coverage and access, found Texas ranked 34th overall, 43rd in the health of women and children, and 40th in the health of seniors.

Bright spots include lower than average tobacco use in the state, with the adult smoking rate ranked the 12th lowest in the nation and the youth rate of tobacco use ranked 5th lowest in the nation. Texas also performed better than average on some measures of mental health, including ranking 15th in the nation on a measure of adult frequent mental distress and 20th in the nation on the teen suicide rate. 

However, Texas performs among the worst in the nation on many key measures of health outcomes, coverage, and access.  For example, Texas has the worst uninsured rate in the nation and ranks 45th in the nation in primary care access. Texas ranks poorly for its children’s well check-up rates (49th for babies ages 0-2 and 48th for adolescents ages 12-17) and 40th for childhood immunizations. In 2018, Texas had the 7th highest teen birth rate.

Texas also performs poorly on minimizing a number of risk factors that can contribute to major preventable health issues. For example, Texas ranks 40th in the nation for adult obesity, 35th for obesity among women of childbearing age, and 50th for senior obesity; this obesity rate has been steadily trending up. Obesity is a significant risk factor for a number of poor health outcomes, including Type II diabetes and many heart conditions. Texas adults rank 40th in the nation for the diabetes rate (and 49th among seniors) and 34th in the nation for the cardiovascular death rate. Understanding risk factor rates and prevalence of health conditions by life stage is the foundation to targeting health interventions when and how they can most effectively meet the unique needs of Texans.

In addition, the impact of COVID-19 has demonstrated that Texas, like the rest of the nation, has a long way to go to reduce health disparities. When adjusted for age, the COVID-19 death rate as of November 2020 was more than twice as high among Black Texans and more than four times as high among Hispanic Texans as the death rate among White Texans. In another striking demonstration of health disparities, the infant mortality rate for Black Texas infants was nearly double the mortality rate for other races/ethnicities. Such disparities in health outcomes can be driven by a number of factors. For example, people of color make up 61% of the nonelderly Texas population but account for 76% of the total nonelderly uninsured population. Recognizing where disparities exist is the first step in understanding what measures can be taken to move all Texans forward in an equitable way.

Texas is a state rich with opportunities but lags behind its peers in terms of health care outcomes and access. All Texans deserve a health care system that is affordable, accessible, and supportive of a high quality of life and economic productivity. The Health Evaluation of Life Phases (HELP) tool can help Texas citizens and policymakers see where Texas is performing well, and where Texas can design solutions to help the state perform more competitively among peer states.

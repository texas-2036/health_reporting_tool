The Health Evaluation of Life Phases (HELP) tool is a resource provided by Texas 2036 to help everyone in the Lone Star State better understand the broad challenges facing our growing population of almost 29 million people.

To do this, we've worked with Dell Medical School at The University of Texas at Austin to organize indicators of those challenges across four phases of life: Maternity, Childhood/Adolescence, Working Age, and Aging. We've highlighted data about risk factors, conditions, and policies that are particularly impactful for each life phase. We’ve also spotlighted the impact of COVID-19 on Texas, including discussing the groups of Texans with the greatest chance of having severe illness based on risk factors.

To learn more about challenges within each phase of life or about COVID-19 in Texas, please explore each of the pages presented below or by using the links to the left. An executive summary of the tool’s findings is
featured below the life stage navigation.

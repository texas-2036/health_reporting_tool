Building a Healthy Texas is a resource provided by Texas 2036 to help everyone in the Lone Star State better understand the broad challenges facing our growing population of almost 29 million people.

To do this, we've worked in consultation with Dell Medical School at the University of Texas at Austin to organize multiple datasets related to those challenges in the context of four life stages: Maternity, Childhood, Working Age, and Aging. In each life stage, we've highlighted data about risk factors, conditions, and policies that are particularly impactful on those life stages. We’ve also spotlighted the impact of COVID-19 on Texas, including discussing the Texans with the greatest chance of having severe illness based on risk factors.

To learn more about challenges within each life stage or about COVID-19 in Texas, please explore each of the pages presented below or by using the links to the left.

Social isolation is an absence of meaningful social relationships. Social isolation can complicate healthcare and negatively impact physical health and mental well-being. For 2020, Texas ranks 32nd in the nation in a measurement of risk of social isolation among people age 65 and over.

Strong social networks have been shown to improve the management of chronic illness, as well as physical and cognitive health. Seniors who are socially isolated may not benefit from the buffering effects of social support while experiencing the stressful life events common to aging. Social isolation is also associated with lower use of healthcare, increased risk of mortality, self-reported fair or poor health status, and other health outcomes such as dementia and coronary heart disease or stroke.

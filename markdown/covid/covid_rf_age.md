The risk for severe illness from COVID-19 increases with age, with older adults at highest risk. Severe illness means that the person with COVID-19 may require hospitalization, intensive care, or a ventilator to help them breathe, or they may even die.

About 8 in 10 COVID-19 deaths reported in Texas have been among adults 60 years old and older. Residents of nursing facilities and assisted living centers have been particularly hard hit with 6,228 deaths among residents as of December 1, 2020, representing over 29% of the state's total deaths.

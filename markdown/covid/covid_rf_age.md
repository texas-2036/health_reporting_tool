The risk for severe illness from COVID-19 increases with age, with older adults at highest risk. Severe illness means that the person with COVID-19 may require hospitalization, intensive care, or a ventilator to help them breathe, or they may even die.

Residents of nursing facilities and assisted living centers have been particularly hard hit with 4,836 deaths as of October 18, 2020, representing over a quarter of the stateâ€™s total deaths.

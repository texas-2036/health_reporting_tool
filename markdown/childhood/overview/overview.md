In 2018, Texas had almost 7.4 million children and youth under age 18, representing 25.6% of the total Texas population. Texas is following the overall trend in the United States of children representing a declining share of the population. Yet since 2010, Texas saw the highest rate of under-18 numerical population growth (7.6%) among the six most populous states and the second-highest in the nation, behind North Dakota. By 2050, Texas is projected to have over 10.7 million children and youth under age 18.

Establishing a healthy lifestyle and receiving the appropriate preventive care in childhood lays the foundation for the youth of today to have good health, educational, and workforce outcomes in the future. Making sure children get timely developmental screenings and recommended health care services is key to finding health problems early, when they’re usually easier to treat. In addition, positive health behaviors — like getting enough physical activity and eating healthy — can help prevent diseases and injuries in children.

Adolescence is a timeframe in which individuals can continue to reinforce healthy behaviors but may also begin to experience mental health and substance use issues and be particularly susceptible to social influences.

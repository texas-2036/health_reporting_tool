Both in Texas and nationally, teen suicide rates have increased over the past few years. Texas ranked 20th among all states and 9th among Texas 2036 peer states with 12.0 deaths by suicide per 100,000 adolescents.

Suicide is a serious public health problem among teens. In 2018, there were 242 deaths among adolescents and young adults ages 15-19 across Texas, making it the second-leading cause of death for that age group behind unintentional accidents.

Many more adolescents have suicidal thoughts or attempt suicide and survive than those who die by suicide. In 2019, [18.9 percent](https://yrbs-explorer.services.cdc.gov/#/tables?questionCode=H26&topicCode=C01&year=2019) of Texas high school students seriously considered attempting suicide and [10.0 percent](https://yrbs-explorer.services.cdc.gov/#/tables?questionCode=H28&topicCode=C01&year=2019) attempted suicide.

The cost of suicide attempts in the United States in 2013 was estimated to be [$58.4 billion](https://doi.org/10.1111/sltb.12225). The average cost per suicide for adolescents and young adults ages 15-24 is estimated to be at least $1.4 million, with most of the cost resulting from lost productivity.

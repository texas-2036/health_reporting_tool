Diabetes is the seventh leading cause of death in the United States. In the last 20 years, the number of adults diagnosed with diabetes has more than doubled. The likelihood of developing diabetes as an adult can be rooted in the health status and health behaviors in youth.

The rate of new cases of diabetes in youths younger than 20 years increased in the United States between 2002 and 2015, with a 4.8% increase per year for type 2 diabetes.

Type 2 diabetes is a preventable condition that can be influenced during childhood by developing healthy behaviors, like having good nutrition and getting plenty of exercise. In pre-diabetes, blood sugar levels are higher than normal, but not high enough yet to be diagnosed as type 2 diabetes. In the United States, about 1 of 5 adolescents and 1 of 4 young adults have prediabetes.

Pre-diabetes is strongly correlated with obesity, because those who are overweight are more likely to have insulin resistance. Other factors that increase kidsâ€™ risk for type 2 diabetes:


* Having a family member with type 2 diabetes.
* Being born to a mom who had diabetes while pregnant
* Being African American, Hispanic/Latino, Native American/Alaska Native, Asian American, or Pacific Islander.
* Having one or more conditions related to insulin resistance.

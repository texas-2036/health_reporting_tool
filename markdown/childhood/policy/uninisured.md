Texas has the highest rate in the nation of children without insurance. In 2018, 21.7% of all uninsured children and youth under the age of 19 in the U.S. lived in Texas. Texas has more than double the U.S. rate of uninsured children, with an uninsured rate of 11.1% in Texas versus 5.2% in the U.S. Massachusetts had the lowest child uninsured rate at 1.2%.

After passage of the Affordable Care Act, uninsurance rates declined significantly before rebounding starting in 2016.  Texas experienced the highest number of additional uninsured children from 2016 to 2018 at 121,000 and the second highest rate increase at 1.4 percent.

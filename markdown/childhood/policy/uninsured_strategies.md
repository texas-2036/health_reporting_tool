The uninsured rate among children is generally lower than the uninsured rate among adults in the U.S. This is largely due to eligibility standards forchildren being more generous through Medicaid and the Children’s Health Insurance Program (CHIP). In Texas, these two programs provide coverage for children with incomes up to 200% of the federal poverty level, and for most children with disabilities at all income levels. However, not all children that are eligible for these programs are enrolled in them.

Accordingly, a key strategy for increasing the number of insured children doesn’t involve creating or expanding any programs, but simply maximizing utilization of existing ones.  Enrollment can be boosted by  increasing outreach and enrollment assistance for families with children eligible for Medicaid, CHIP, and other health coverage. Schools and community-based organizations can play an important role in these efforts as they are embedded in and familiar with the communities that may benefit from outreach activities.

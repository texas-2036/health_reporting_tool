Vaccines can have a large impact on reducing the rates of many serious diseases. However, outbreaks continue of vaccine-preventable illnesses, such as measles, mumps, and pertussis. Children also can be susceptible to severe illness from influenza, the spread of which can be diminished through annual flu vaccinations. Flu vaccination in the 2020-2021 flu season is especially critical as the nation is also contending with the ongoing spread and related demand on healthcare capacity of COVID-19. 

Pertussis, commonly known as whooping cough, is an example of a potentially severe, vaccine-preventable disease. Young children are recommended to get 4 doses of the DTaP (diphtheria, tetanus, acellular pertussis) vaccine. The CDC states that about half of infants under 1 year of age that get pertussis will require hospitalization. Among infants hospitalized for whooping cough, [about 1 in 4 will get pneumonia and about 1 in 100 will die](https://www.cdc.gov/pertussis/pregnant/mom/deadly-disease-for-baby.html). 

In addition, many cancers in both men and women can be prevented if adolescents get the human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine. Yet rates of this vaccination have significant room for improvement. Strategies to make sure more adolescents get vaccinated include using vaccination information systems, sending patient reminders, and starting vaccination programs in schools.

Between 2010 and 2016, the obesity rate among children ages 2 to 4 who participate in the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) declined significantly. WIC provides healthy foods and nutrition education to pregnant women, mothers, and children under age 5. The CDC does not definitively determine the reasons for the decline in obesity rates, but suggests local, state, and national initiatives, as well as recent updates to the WIC food package, may have played a role.

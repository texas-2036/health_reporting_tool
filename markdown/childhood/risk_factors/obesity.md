The percentage of children ages 10-17 who are overweight or obese in Texas is 33.5%, which ranks the state 36th in the nation. The United States figure is 31.0% with other state-specific percentages ranging from 22.4% to 40.1%. The  overall youth obesity rate has been trending upwards through the years.

Poor nutrition, lack of physical activity, and the presence of chronic health conditions can contribute to the rate of overweight and obesity. Children with obesity are more likely to be bullied and to have obesity as adults. In turn, obesity is linked to conditions later in life like high blood pressure, high cholesterol, diabetes, asthma, anxiety, and depression.

Evidence suggests that intensive behavioral programs that use more than one strategy are an effective way to reduce childhood obesity. Policy and school curriculum changes that make it easier for children and adolescents to eat healthy and get physical activity can also help reduce obesity.

Regular physical activity can help children and adolescents improve cardiorespiratory fitness, build strong bones and muscles, control weight, reduce symptoms of anxiety and depression, and reduce the risk of developing health conditions such as:

* Heart disease
* Cancer
* Type 2 diabetes
* High blood pressure
* Osteoporosis
* Obesity

While there were gains in physical activity from 2007-2013 among high school students, the trend has declined since that year.  In 2019, just 22.9 percent of Texas high school students were active for 60 minutes or more on all seven of the past seven days (in accordance with CDC recommendations).  This compares to 23.2 percent nationally.

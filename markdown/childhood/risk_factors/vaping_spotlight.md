In Texas, vaping use steadily increases by grade level. In 2019, 12.9 percent of Texas 9th graders vaped, while 22.1 percent of 12th graders vaped.  Vaping use also was significantly higher among white students (30.9 percent) compared to Hispanic or Latino students (14.5 percent), or black or African American students (9.8 percent).

Electronic vaping products also have been popular due to the variety of flavors that were available. Now flavors have largely been banned in tobacco products with the exception of menthol. Public health officials hope the flavor ban will reduce the initiation of vaping product use. However, some policymakers would like to go further and ban the use of menthol flavor as well.  Use of menthol-flavored tobacco products is disproportionately high among African American and other populations of color. More than half of smokers ages 12-17 smoke menthols.

Use of Menthol-flavored Tobacco Products by Race/Ethnicity Among Tobacco Users:

* 85.8 percent - African Americans
* 46 percent - Hispanics
* 39 percent - Asian Americans
* 28.7 percent -  Whites

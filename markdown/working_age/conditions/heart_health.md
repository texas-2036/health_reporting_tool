Heart-related illness is one of the worst conditions in the U.S. for the number of years lost due to ill health, disability or early death.  Heart disease and stroke are the first and fifth leading causes of death in the United States. Heart disease, stroke, and other vascular diseases contribute to approximately 800,000 deaths per year and 200,000 preventable deaths among those younger than 75.

Texas ranks 34th out of states for cardiovascular-related deaths. The rate of deaths from these conditions had been trending down, but in the last few years started to rise again, in part due to increases in risk factors such as obesity and diabetes.

The estimated direct medical costs and lost productivity attributable to cardiovascular disease was [$555 billion](http://www.heart.org/idc/groups/heart-

Many risk factors for heart disease can be controlled - smoking, cholesterol levels, uncontrolled high blood pressure (hypertension), physical inactivity, obesity, uncontrolled diabetes, and stress.

In 2018, almost 1/3 of adult Texans (32.2%) reported they had been told by a health professional that they have high blood pressure. This was up from 29.5% in 2016. Uncontrolled high blood pressure can lead to complications including heart attack or stroke, heart failure, and trouble with memory/dementia.It is highly treatable.

Across the U.S., among those with high blood pressure, about 64 million are aware of their condition and 57 million are taking blood pressureâ€“lowering medication; however, only about half have their blood pressure under control. In 2011 high blood pressure was associated with $45 billion in direct medical costs.

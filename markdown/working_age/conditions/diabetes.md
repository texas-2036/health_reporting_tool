The rate of adults with diabetes increased 35% from 2004 to 2016, with a rate of 8.1% in 2004, increasing to 10.9% in 2016. The Texas rate has consistently exceeded the rate in the United States, which was 8.5% in 2016.

Appropriate preventive care can minimize associated poor health outcomes and avoidable medical utilization from diabetes.

About half of all people in the United States will be diagnosed with a mental disorder at some point in their lifetime. Mental disorders affect people of all age and racial/ethnic groups, but some populations are disproportionately affected. And estimates suggest that only half of all people with mental disorders get the treatment they need.

A healthy mental state is essential to overall positive health and well-being. In some cases, poor mental health may lead to suicide, the tenth leading cause of death for all ages.

In addition, mental health and physical health are closely connected. Mental disorders like depression and anxiety can affect peopleâ€™s ability to take part in healthy behaviors. Similarly, physical health problems can make it harder for people to get treatment for mental disorders. Increasing screening for mental disorders can help people get the treatment they need.

When including institutionalized and active-duty military, direct medical spending associated with mental health disorders (including anxiety, depression and dementia) in the U.S. reached $201 billion in 2013, surpassing costs for heart disease ($147 billion) and traumatic injury ($143 billion).

Texas ranks 15th in the percentage of adults (11.7%) who reported their mental health was not good 14 or more days in the past 30 days. Both in Texas and nationally, the rate of adults reporting frequent mental distress has increased over the past several years. For Texas adults ages 18-44, the rate was 12%, and for those ages 45-64, it was 12.7%.

Frequent mental distress is a measure based on self-reported poor mental health days. The measure aims to capture the population experiencing persistent, and likely severe, mental health issues, which may have a significant impact on health-related quality of life and overall wellness. The cutoff point of 14 or more days of poor mental health is used to capture frequent mental distress. There is a strong relationship between the 14-day period and clinically diagnosed mental disorders, such as depression and anxiety.

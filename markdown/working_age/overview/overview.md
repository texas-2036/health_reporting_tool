In 2021, 61.3% of Texans will be in the workforce-age population, ages 18 to 64. By 2036, Texas’ 18 to 64 population is expected to be a smaller share of the state population at 59.5%.  This smaller workforce will continue to drive the economy and raise the state’s children. They also will likely play a larger role in caregiving for older adults as the percent of the Texas population age 65 and older increases from 13.5% in 2021 to 16.7% in 2036.

The lifestyle and preventive health practices of workforce-age adults are critical in avoiding the development of many chronic health conditions, such as heart conditions, diabetes, asthma, and cancer, that adversely impact quality of life, positive family and community interactions, and workforce productivity.

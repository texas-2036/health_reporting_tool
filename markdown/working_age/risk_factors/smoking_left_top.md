The Healthy People 2020 goal is to reduce the smoking rate to 12.0%. Texas compares favorably to the United States in terms of the smoking rate. The Texas adult smoking rate is 14.4% versus the national average of 16.1%. The national range is 9.0% to 25.2%.

However, there are significant racial and ethnic disparities in smoking rates, particularly for Native American/Alaskan Natives and blacks.

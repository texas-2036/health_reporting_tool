The total estimated cost of obesity for non-institutionalized adults in the United States in 2013 was $342.2 billion.^[1]

Compared with healthy weight adults, individuals with obesity in the U.S. spend on average $3,429 more per person annually^[1] on medical care.

A 2011 study projects that medical costs for all obesity-related preventable diseases in the U.S. will increase $48 to $66 billion per year by 2030^[2] mainly due to the rising prevalence of obesity.

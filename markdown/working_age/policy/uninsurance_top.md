Health insurance helps increase the likelihood that people receive the health care care they need and avoid accruing prohibitive medical debt. Compared to those with insurance, the uninsured were **four times more likely to lack a usual source of health care and more likely to postpone medical care or forego medical care due to cost.**

Compared with insured adults, uninsured adults have more health disadvantages, including:

* Worse health outcomes and higher rates of mortality and premature death
* Higher rates of cancer mortality and greater risk of a late-stage cancer diagnosis
* Reduced access to quality care including preventive services
* More instances of severe acute medical issues due to undiagnosed or untreated chronic conditions requiring more emergency room visits

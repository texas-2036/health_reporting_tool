In the past two years, the number of mental health providers increased 14% from 98.3 to 111.8 per 100,000. Yet this still places Texas at 49th in terms of mental health care access with a range of 100.7 to 626.6 per 100,000 nationally, with a national average of 247.4.

People with untreated mental illness risk worse health outcomes for their co-occurring medical conditions, loss of productivity, higher incarceration rates, poorer educational outcomes, and many other factors.

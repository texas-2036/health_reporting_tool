Texas ranks 49th in the nation for the rate of flu vaccinations among adults (46th among adults age 18-44 and 50th among adults age 45-64)^[1]. The vaccination rate trended down significantly to an eight-year low rate of 22.2% in 2018. Increasing the flu vaccination rate will be especially critical this year as flu cases could compete for hospital bed capacity with COVID-19 cases. About 8% of the U.S. population gets sick from flu each season, with a range of between 3% and 11%, depending on the season. Complications of flu can include bacterial pneumonia, ear infections, sinus infections and worsening of chronic medical conditions, such as congestive heart failure, asthma, or diabetes.

People of any age with the following [medical conditions]( https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/need-extra-precautions/groups-at-higher-risk.html) are at increased risk of severe illness from COVID-19:

* Cancer
* Chronic kidney disease
* COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease)
* Immunocompromised state (weakened immune system) from solid organ transplant
* Obesity (body mass index [BMI] of 30 or higher)
* Serious heart conditions, such as heart failure, coronary artery disease, or cardiomyopathies
* Sickle cell disease
* Type 2 diabetes mellitus

COVID-19 is a new disease. Currently there are limited data and information about the impact of underlying medical conditions and whether they increase the risk for severe illness from COVID-19. Based on what we know at this time, people with many other conditions might be at an increased risk for severe illness from COVID-19, including asthma, high blood pressure, pregnancy, dementia, and smoking.

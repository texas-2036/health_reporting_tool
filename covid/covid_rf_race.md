COVID-19 disproportionately impacts communities of color, particularly Black and Hispanic communities. A striking example is that Hispanics represent 39.3% of the Texas population but 56% of COVID-19-related deaths. When adjusted for age, as of October 13, 2020, the COVID-19 death rate is 33.1 per 100,000 for White Texans, 79.2 per 100,000 for Black Texans, and 140 per 100,000 for Hispanic Texans. COVID-19 racial and ethnic disparities are greater when age adjusted because COVID-19 causes more death among older persons and the proportion of older persons is larger among White Texans than Black and Hispanic Texans.

Many factors could influence these disparities, such as:

*	Occupation: Higher rates of employment in essential jobs, like healthcare and transportation, that result in more exposure to the public;
*	Healthcare access and utilization:  Racial and ethnic minorities have lower insurance rates, may be less likely to trust the broader healthcare system, and may face more transportation, child care, or work leave challenges when trying to see a healthcare provider;
*	Housing: Greater likelihood of living in multi-generational or multi-family housing; and
*	Medical conditions: Greater prevalence of conditions like obesity, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease that place people at higher risk of severe illness and death.
*
It is important to note that the DSHS rates shown in the pie charts are based on crude rates that are not age-adjusted. Also, Texasâ€™ case breakdown by race and ethnicity is based only on the confirmed cases for which DSHS has received completed case investigations (fewer than 10% of confirmed cases.)

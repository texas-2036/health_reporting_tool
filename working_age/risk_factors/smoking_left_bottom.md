Smoking is a major risk factor for cancers, cardiovascular conditions such as heart disease and stroke, and respiratory conditions, such as asthma and COPD. Exposure to smoking is a major risk factor in having healthy birth outcomes.

As the leading cause of preventable death and disease in the United States, cigarette smoking is responsible for more than 480,000 deaths every year. Smokers live 10 years less than non-smokers, on average.
